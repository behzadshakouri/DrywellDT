// Thread-safe append-only logger for forward and inverse run records.
// Both DTRunner (main thread, forward stages) and DTAssimilation
// (assim thread, calibration cycles) write to the same outputs/run_log.csv
// via recordRun().  A QMutex serializes file appends so rows are atomic;
// a std::atomic counter assigns globally-unique run_ids.
//
// Lifetime: owned by DTRunner.  A raw pointer is handed to DTAssimilation
// which must outlive its assim thread (DTRunner ensures this in its
// destructor by joining the thread before m_assimilation is destroyed).
